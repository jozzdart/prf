# Changelog

All notable changes to the **prf** package will be documented in this file.

## 2.2.5

#### üß≠ Tracker Services

- Introduced a new high-level utility:

  - **`PrfPeriodicCounter`** ‚Äî a drop-in persistent counter that resets itself automatically at the start of each aligned period (e.g. daily, hourly, every 5 minutes).  
    Tracks actions like "daily logins", "hourly submissions", or "weekly attempts" with zero boilerplate.

    ```dart
    final counter = PrfPeriodicCounter('daily_uploads', period: TrackerPeriod.daily);
    await counter.increment();  // +1 today
    final total = await counter.get(); // auto-resets each day at midnight
    ```

    Backed by `PrfIso<int>` and supports `.get()`, `.increment()`, `.reset()`, `.clear()` and `hasState()`.

- All tracker tools are now covered by **extensive tests** ‚Äî including 150 dedicated tests for the new trackers ‚Äî to ensure proper state reset, timestamp alignment, and session persistence.
- These tools are designed for advanced use cases like counters, streaks, timers, and rolling metrics ‚Äî allowing custom persistent services to be built cleanly and safely. All built on top of `PrfIso<T>` ‚Äî fully isolate-safe.

### Foundation for tracking tools

- Introduced new foundational classes for building persistent tracking tools:

  - `BaseTracker<T>` ‚Äî a reusable base for timestamp-aware persistent values, with automatic expiry handling and fallback logic.
  - `BaseCounterTracker` ‚Äî a numeric extension of `BaseTracker<int>` that adds `.increment()` and standardized zero fallback, ideal for counters.
  - `TrackerPeriod` ‚Äî an enum of aligned time periods (e.g. `minutes10`, `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`) with built-in `.duration` and `.alignedStart(DateTime)` helpers.

## 2.2.4

- Added factory methods:
  - `Prf.json<T>(...)` and `Prf.enumerated<T>(...)`
  - `PrfIso.json(...)` and `PrfIso.enumerated(...)`
- Added `.isolated` getter on `Prf<T>` for isolate-safe access.
- Expanded native type support:
  - Built-in adapters for `num`, `Uri`, `List<int>`, `List<bool>`, `List<double>`, `List<DateTime>` now supported out of the box with all `prf` values! (with efficient binary encoding under the hood)
- All adapters are now `const` for reduced memory usage and better performance.
- Updated README documentation.
- Now isolated `prfs` can easily be created like this:

```dart
final isoValue = Prf<String>('username').isolated;
```

**Changes and Deprecations:**

- Renamed `Prfy<T>` ‚Üí `PrfIso<T>`.
- Added deprecation annotations with migration instructions.
- Deprecated classes (to be removed in v3.0.0):
  - `PrfJson<T>` ‚Üí `Prf.json<T>(...)`
  - `PrfEnum<T>` ‚Üí `Prf.enumerated<T>(...)`
  - `Prfy<T>` ‚Üí `PrfIso<T>`
  - `PrfyJson<T>` ‚Üí `PrfIso.json<T>(...)`
  - `PrfyEnum<T>` ‚Üí `PrfIso.enumerated<T>(...)`
  - Or alternatively: `Prf.json<T>(...).isolated`, `Prf.enumerated<T>(...).isolated`
- Added extensive tests for every single adapter, with more than 300 tests - all adapters are heavily tested to ensure data integrity.

## 2.2.3

- Fixed `Prf.value<T>()` not being static as intended.

## 2.2.2

- Updated README

## 2.2.1

### Added

- **Instant Cached Access**:  
  Introduced `.cachedValue` getter for `Prf<T>` objects to access the last loaded value **without async**.
- **`Prf.value<T>()` factory**:  
  Added `Prf.value<T>()` constructor that automatically loads the stored value into memory, making `.cachedValue` immediately usable after initialization.

  Example:

  ```dart
  final score = await Prf.value<int>('user_score');
  print(score.cachedValue); // No async needed
  ```

  - After calling `Prf.value()`, you can access `.cachedValue` instantly.
  - If no value exists, `.cachedValue` will be the `defaultValue` or `null`.

### Notes

- This feature improves UI performance where fast access to settings or preferences is needed.
- Reminder: `Prf<T>` is optimized for speed but **not isolate-safe** ‚Äî use `Prfy<T>` when isolate safety is required.

## 2.2.0

### Major Update

- **Unified API**:  
  Consolidated all legacy `PrfX` classes (`PrfBool`, `PrfInt`, `PrfDouble`, etc.) into a single generic structure:

  - `Prf<T>` ‚Äî **Cached**, fast access (not isolate-safe by design).
  - `Prfy<T>` ‚Äî **Isolate-safe**, no internal caching, always reads from storage.

- **Adapter-Based Architecture**:  
  Added modular adapter system (`PrfAdapter<T>`) with built-in adapters for:

  - Primitive types (`bool`, `int`, `double`, `String`, `List<String>`)
  - Encoded types (`DateTime`, `Duration`, `BigInt`, `Uint8List`, Enums, JSON)

- **Backward Compatibility**:  
  Legacy `PrfX` classes remain available, internally powered by the new adapter system.

- **Extensibility**:  
  Developers can register custom type adapters via `PrfAdapterMap.instance.register()`.

- **Internal Reorganization**:  
  Major file structure improvements (`core/`, `prf_types/`, `prfy_types/`, `services/`) for better modularity and future expansion.

### Fixed

- **Isolate Safety Issue (Issue #3)** ([stuartmorgan-g](https://github.com/stuartmorgan-g)):  
  Previously, `prf` incorrectly advertised full isolate safety while using internal caching.  
  This release properly separates behavior:

  - `Prfy<T>` values are **truly isolate-safe**, always reading from `SharedPreferencesAsync` without cache.
  - `Prf<T>` values **use caching** for performance, but are **not isolate-safe** across isolates (expected Dart behavior).
  - README and comparison tables have been updated to accurately reflect these distinctions and explain the cache behavior clearly.

- Corrected claims about `shared_preferences` caching behavior ‚Äî acknowledged that `SharedPreferencesWithCache` **does** have Dart-side caching.

- Clarified that naive Dart caching, like in `Prf<T>`, shares the same limitations as `SharedPreferencesWithCache` regarding multi-isolate consistency.

### Added

- `PrfyJson<T>` ‚Äî Safe JSON object storage across isolates.
- `PrfyEnum<T>` ‚Äî Safe enum storage across isolates.
- `PrfJson<T>` ‚Äî Cached JSON object storage.
- `PrfEnum<T>` ‚Äî Cached enum storage.
- `DateTimeAdapter`, `DurationAdapter`, `BigIntAdapter`, `BytesAdapter` for encoded types.
- `PrfCooldown` and `PrfRateLimiter` now internally use the new types.

### Changed

- Updated README to accurately describe:

  - Isolate-safe usage patterns (`Prfy`).
  - Cache-optimized usage patterns (`Prf`).
  - Caching behavior and limitations compared to `shared_preferences`.

- Improved internal documentation on the adapter registration system and best practices.

## 2.1.3

- Fixed issues related to pub.dev formatting

## 2.1.2

- Fixed problems with README formatting

## 2.1.1

- Shortened package description in pubspec.yaml to comply with pub.dev length requirements

## 2.1.0

### Added

- **`PrfCooldown`** utility for managing persistent cooldown periods with built-in tracking and duration handling
- **`PrfRateLimiter`** industry-grade token bucket limiter using `prf` types for rolling-rate restrictions (e.g. `1000 actions per 15 minutes`)
- **New typed variables**:
  - `PrfTheme` ‚Äì store theme mode (`light`, `dark`, `system`)
  - `PrfDuration` ‚Äì store `Duration` as microseconds
  - `PrfBigInt` ‚Äì store `BigInt` as a string
- `removeAll()` method in `PrfCooldown` and `PrfRateLimiter` to clear all related sub-keys
- `overrideWith()` and `resetOverride()` methods in `Prf` to inject custom `SharedPreferencesAsync` instance for testing
- Detailed migration documentation for:
  - Migrating from `SharedPreferences`
  - Migrating from `SharedPreferencesAsync`
  - Migrating from legacy `prf`
- README coverage for isolate support and compatibility

### Changed

- Internal singleton of `Prf` now supports override injection for better testability
- Updated comparison table in README to highlight isolate safety, caching, and type support

### Fixed

- Deprecated `Prf.clear(...)` to discourage unintentional global wipes ‚Äî use `Prf.instance.clear()` instead for clarity and safety

## 2.0.0

### Internals migrated to SharedPreferencesAsync

üö® **Behavioral Breaking Change** (no API changes)

### TL;DR ‚Äî Do You Need to Do Anything?

- ‚úÖ **No action needed** if:
  - Your app is new and doesn't rely on previously stored values, or
  - You were **already using `SharedPreferencesAsync`** ‚Äî everything will continue to work seamlessly.
- üîÅ **Run a migration** if:
  - Your app was using `prf` prior to this version (pre-2.0.0)
  - You want to preserve previously stored values

```dart
await PrfService.migrateFromLegacyPrefsIfNeeded();
```

---

### üß† Why this change?

`prf` now uses `SharedPreferencesAsync` under the hood ‚Äî the **new, isolate-safe**, officially recommended backend for shared preferences.

This change future-proofs `prf` and avoids issues caused by the old `SharedPreferences` API, which:

- Is being **deprecated**
- Is **not isolate-safe**
- Does **not guarantee disk persistence** on write ([source](https://medium.com/@thejussomaraj546/sharedpreferences-b2a36be724e6))

---

### üõ† Migration Instructions

If your app used `prf` previously and stored data you want to keep:

```dart
await Prf.migrateFromLegacyPrefsIfNeeded();
```

This safely copies data from the legacy storage backend to the new one.  
It's safe to run every time ‚Äî the migration will only happen once.

---

### ‚úÖ What's new in 2.0.0:

- Internals now use `SharedPreferencesAsync`
- Full **isolate-safety**, suitable for background plugins like `firebase_messaging`
- Removed reliance on `getInstance()` and internal platform-side caching
- `prf` now fully controls its own cache
- Public API is **unchanged** ‚Äî `get()`, `set()`, `remove()` all still work the same

---

### üîÅ Key Differences

| Feature                | Before (`1.x`)             | After (`2.0.0`)        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Backend                | SharedPreferences (legacy) | SharedPreferencesAsync |
| Android storage method | SharedPreferences XML      | DataStore Preferences  |
| Isolate-safe           | ‚ùå No                      | ‚úÖ Yes                 |

---

### üí¨ Summary

This is a critical under-the-hood upgrade to ensure `prf` is compatible with modern Flutter apps, isolate-safe, and ready for the future of shared preferences.

If your app is new, or you don't care about previously stored data ‚Äî you're done ‚úÖ  
If you're upgrading and need old values ‚Äî migrate once as shown above.
