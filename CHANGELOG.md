# Changelog

All notable changes to the **prf** package will be documented in this file.

## 2.1.2

- Fixed problems with README formatting

## 2.1.1

- Shortened package description in pubspec.yaml to comply with pub.dev length requirements

## 2.1.0

### Added

- **`PrfCooldown`** utility for managing persistent cooldown periods with built-in tracking and duration handling
- **`PrfRateLimiter`** industry-grade token bucket limiter using `prf` types for rolling-rate restrictions (e.g. `1000 actions per 15 minutes`)
- **New typed variables**:
  - `PrfTheme` ‚Äì store theme mode (`light`, `dark`, `system`)
  - `PrfDuration` ‚Äì store `Duration` as microseconds
  - `PrfBigInt` ‚Äì store `BigInt` as a string
- `removeAll()` method in `PrfCooldown` and `PrfRateLimiter` to clear all related sub-keys
- `overrideWith()` and `resetOverride()` methods in `Prf` to inject custom `SharedPreferencesAsync` instance for testing
- Detailed migration documentation for:
  - Migrating from `SharedPreferences`
  - Migrating from `SharedPreferencesAsync`
  - Migrating from legacy `prf`
- README coverage for isolate support and compatibility

### Changed

- Internal singleton of `Prf` now supports override injection for better testability
- Updated comparison table in README to highlight isolate safety, caching, and type support

### Fixed

- Deprecated `Prf.clear(...)` to discourage unintentional global wipes ‚Äî use `Prf.instance.clear()` instead for clarity and safety

## 2.0.0

### Internals migrated to SharedPreferencesAsync

üö® **Behavioral Breaking Change** (no API changes)

### TL;DR ‚Äî Do You Need to Do Anything?

- ‚úÖ **No action needed** if:
  - Your app is new and doesn't rely on previously stored values, or
  - You were **already using `SharedPreferencesAsync`** ‚Äî everything will continue to work seamlessly.
- üîÅ **Run a migration** if:
  - Your app was using `prf` prior to this version (pre-2.0.0)
  - You want to preserve previously stored values

```dart
await Prf.migrateFromLegacyPrefsIfNeeded();
```

---

### üß† Why this change?

`prf` now uses `SharedPreferencesAsync` under the hood ‚Äî the **new, isolate-safe**, officially recommended backend for shared preferences.

This change future-proofs `prf` and avoids issues caused by the old `SharedPreferences` API, which:

- Is being **deprecated**
- Is **not isolate-safe**
- Does **not guarantee disk persistence** on write ([source](https://medium.com/@thejussomaraj546/sharedpreferences-b2a36be724e6))

---

### üõ† Migration Instructions

If your app used `prf` previously and stored data you want to keep:

```dart
await Prf.migrateFromLegacyPrefsIfNeeded();
```

This safely copies data from the legacy storage backend to the new one.  
It‚Äôs safe to run every time ‚Äî the migration will only happen once.

---

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs new in 2.0.0:

- Internals now use `SharedPreferencesAsync`
- Full **isolate-safety**, suitable for background plugins like `firebase_messaging`
- Removed reliance on `getInstance()` and internal platform-side caching
- `prf` now fully controls its own cache
- Public API is **unchanged** ‚Äî `get()`, `set()`, `remove()` all still work the same

---

### üîÅ Key Differences

| Feature                | Before (`1.x`)             | After (`2.0.0`)        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Backend                | SharedPreferences (legacy) | SharedPreferencesAsync |
| Android storage method | SharedPreferences XML      | DataStore Preferences  |
| Isolate-safe           | ‚ùå No                      | ‚úÖ Yes                 |

---

### üí¨ Summary

This is a critical under-the-hood upgrade to ensure `prf` is compatible with modern Flutter apps, isolate-safe, and ready for the future of shared preferences.

If your app is new, or you don‚Äôt care about previously stored data ‚Äî you're done ‚úÖ  
If you‚Äôre upgrading and need old values ‚Äî migrate once as shown above.

## 1.3.8

- Added example file for pub.dev to showcase package usage.

## 1.3.7

- Finished setting up for publishing, this package was private for too long in my repositoriee, hope you enjoy it!

## 1.3.6

- Added omprehensive documentation comments for the entire library.
- Improved API reference with examples and usage notes.
- Enhanced dartdoc coverage for all public classes and methods.
- Better explanation of advanced features and type support.

## 1.3.5

- Improved `PrfDateTime` encoding reliability by enforcing endian order consistency.
- Fixed internal handling of corrupted `base64` data for `PrfBytes`.

## 1.3.4

### Added

- `PrfJson<T>` class for storing JSON-serializable objects using `jsonEncode`/`jsonDecode`.
- Graceful fallback when decoding invalid JSON or mismatched types.

## 1.3.3

### Added

- `PrfDateTime` using base64-encoded 64-bit integers to persist `DateTime` values with millisecond precision.
- Integrated with `PrfEncoded` to reduce redundant logic.

## 1.3.2

### Added

- `PrfEncoded<TSource, TStore>` for reusable value transformation between domain objects and SharedPreferences-compatible types.
- Supports encoding formats like JSON, binary, and base64.

## 1.3.1

### Improved

- Added `_exists` check inside `getValue()` to allow fallback to `defaultValue` if key is missing.
- Improved caching logic to avoid unnecessary SharedPreferences reads.

## 1.3.0

### Added

- `PrfVariableExtensions<T>` extension with:
  - `.get()`, `.set(value)`, `.remove()`, `.isNull()`
  - Uses lazy `SharedPreferences` initialization automatically.

### Changed

- Removed requirement to manually call `Prf.init()`. Now fully lazy-loaded via `Prf.getInstance()`.

## 1.2.1

### Fixed

- Minor internal refactor to prevent reinitializing `_initFuture` in `Prf`.

## 1.2.0

### Added

- `PrfBytes` with transparent base64 storage of `Uint8List`.
- Full support for all native SharedPreferences types:
  - `PrfInt`
  - `PrfDouble`
  - `PrfBool`
  - `PrfString`
  - `PrfStringList`

### Improved

- Unified all variable types using delegate-based constructors.
- Internal logic now handles nullability consistently and efficiently.

## 1.1.0

### Added

- `typedef` support for `SharedPrefsGetter<T>` and `SharedPrefsSetter<T>`.
- Simplified `PrfVariable<T>` constructor by using delegates instead of abstract getter/setter classes.

### Changed

- Removed old abstract classes `PrfGetter` and `PrfSetter` in favor of inline functions.

## 1.0.2

### Improved

- Updated internal caching system for better performance on repeated `.get()` calls.

## 1.0.1

### Added

- Added `maybePrefs` and `isInitialized` to `Prf` for improved control over initialization state.

## 1.0.0

### Initial Release

- `PrfVariable<T>` base class with typed getter/setter support.
- Manual `SharedPreferences` injection.
- Clean and extensible architecture for managing preference values.
